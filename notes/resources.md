## latent space

The "hidden" space that encodes the meaningful components of the compressed
data that you are modeling. Called a space because of relation to matrix math
in which we take a matrix of large dimensions and reduce that information to
much smaller dimensions which still retain relevant, or the most important
information, discarding extraneous information in the process.
